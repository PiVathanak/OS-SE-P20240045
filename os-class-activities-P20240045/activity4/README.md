## Questions

1. Why should clients send requests to the server instead of writing the file directly?
2. Why does the server still have a race condition before mutex or synchronized?
3. In the C++ fixed version, what does `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` protect?
4. In the Java fixed version, what does `synchronized` protect?
5. Why is the final score expected to be 20 when Student A sends 10 requests and Student B sends 10 requests?
6. What could happen if two separate servers update the same file at the same time?

## Reflection

_Compare the C++ and Java synchronization approaches. What did this activity teach you about protecting shared resources?_
